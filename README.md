  This is the csv file of data science survey data used for part A of this assignment.

  This is the GeoJSON file that is used to mark the boundaries of the different neighborhoods in San Francisco.
  
**Note:**\
The dataset for Part B, San Franscisco crime dataset, can not be uploaded to GitHub because it has large size. Instead of uploading it, I loaded it directly from the website providing it into *pandas* dataframe. See the code in the notebook.
